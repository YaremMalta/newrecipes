This project was prepared within the scope of the Graduation Thesis course of the
Department of Computer Engineering. It presents the development of an Android recipe
application designed to enhance users' culinary experiences by allowing them to discover,
save, and manage their favorite recipes. The main page of the application features randomly
selected recipes, popular dishes, and various categories, providing a comprehensive
browsing experience. Users can explore recipes by category, add them to their favorites,
and access detailed instructions along with YouTube links for a more interactive cooking
experience.
The application was built using modern Android development practices and libraries,
including Retrofit for network operations, Room for local database management, Glide for
image loading, and ViewModel along with LiveData to implement the MVVM architecture.
These technologies ensure a responsive, efficient, and user-friendly application.
